The State of Palestine is a country in the southern Levant region of West Asia, officially recognized by 146 of 193 United Nations member states. It comprises the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Stripâ€”regions collectively known as the occupied Palestinian territories. Palestine shares most of its borders with Israel, with additional borders with Jordan to the east and Egypt to the southwest. Covering approximately 6,020 square kilometers (2,320 square miles), it is home to over five million people. Its declared capital is Jerusalem, while Ramallah serves as its administrative hub. Gaza City was the largest city before significant evacuations in 2023.

Historically, Palestine's location at the crossroads of Asia and Africa made it a strategic region, facilitating trade and cultural exchanges among empires and serving as a vital link for armies and merchants from North Africa, China, and India. Renowned for its religious importance, Palestine has a diverse historical legacy marked by various ruling empires. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rooted in the rise of the Zionist movement and British involvement during World War I, has profoundly impacted the region. In 1917, Britain assumed control over Palestine from the Ottoman Empire, establishing Mandatory Palestine under the League of Nations. During this period, large-scale Jewish immigration, permitted by British authorities, increased tensions with the local Palestinian Arab population. In 1947, Britain referred the issue to the United Nations, which proposed a partition plan to create independent Arab and Jewish states and an international entity for Jerusalem. However, a civil war ensued, and the plan was not implemented.

In 1948, the Palestine war led to the displacement of a significant portion of the Arab population and the establishment of Israel, which Palestinians refer to as the Nakba ("catastrophe"). In 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the Six-Day War, territories that Jordan and Egypt had previously controlled. In 1988, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) declared independence. The Oslo peace accords signed in 1993 between the PLO and Israel enabled limited self-governance through the Palestinian Authority (PA) in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, the area remains under Israeli military occupation and blockade. Political divisions led to Hamas's takeover of Gaza in 2007, resulting in a split administration, with Fatah overseeing the West Bank under the PA and Hamas governing Gaza. Since 1967, Israel has established large settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, currently home to over 670,000 Israeli settlers, a practice deemed illegal under international law.

Palestine's major challenges include political fragmentation, Israeli occupation, internal divisions, restricted movement, Israeli settlements and settler violence, and ongoing security concerns. Key unresolved issues include the delineation of borders, the legal status of Jerusalem, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Despite these challenges, Palestine has an emerging economy and remains a destination for tourism. Arabic is the official language, with most Palestinians practicing Islam, though there is also a Christian minority. Palestine is a member of various international organizations, including the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and has been a non-member observer state in the United Nations since 2012.
